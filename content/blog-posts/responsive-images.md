Is it a pillow fight, or are there darker undertones in this seemingly cheerful
picture? I don't have an answer for that, but here you'll get a neat trick for
creating truly responsive images.

Is it a pillow fight, or are there darker undertones in this seemingly cheerful
picture? I don't have an answer for that, but here you'll get a neat trick for
creating truly responsive images.

## The Problem

It's not always that a large portrait mode photo fits in properly (and by that,
I mean the layout, not a grinning maniac about to smother you with a pillow).
This is especially true when you need to account for everything from small
mobile phones to the huge screen in the office.

Maybe if there's enough space, you can display the whole image to the left, with
the text on the right side, in such a layout:

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-1">
  <div class="bilde faux"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

So far, so good.

On a slightly narrower screen, maybe something like this would work?

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-2">
  <div class="bilde faux"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

At some point, we'll have to switch to having the image above, and at that point
it becomes absurd:

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-3">
  <div class="bilde faux"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

The image dominates the textual content. Also, there are limits to how much
"Magnar with a pillow" we can handle at once. No, better then to go for such a
layout:

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-4">
  <div class="bilde faux"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

So what's a poor frontend developer to do? One thing's for sure: We don't want
to make three versions of the image.

## Toward a Solution

Good old `<img>` falls short here. We need to be able to adjust the crop size
independently of the content of the image itself. It has to be a `<div>`. Then
we slap the image on as a `background-image`, and well, see for yourself:

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-1">
  <div class="bilde putekrig"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

Okay, there's certainly something decorative with just the upper left corner of
the image, but it's not quite what we envisioned.

Now see what happens when we add `background-size: cover`:

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-1">
  <div class="bilde putekrig cover"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

Excellent!

## Not Quite Excellent

But what happens with the other two sizes we wanted?

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-2">
  <div class="bilde putekrig cover"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

Hmm...

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-4">
  <div class="bilde putekrig cover"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

Well...

It doesn't quite work.

## The Final Trick

To fully perfect this beauty, we can tell the browser where to focus. And we do
that with percentages and `background-position`:

```
background-image: url(/images/pillow.jpg);
background-size: cover;
background-position: 50% 25%;
```

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-2">
  <div class="bilde putekrig cover pos"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

Look at that, the face is right in the middle!

<div class="responsive-bilder ex-4">
  <div class="bilde putekrig cover pos"></div>
  <div class="ark"><div class="tekst"></div></div>
</div>

And here as well!

## From Blog Post to Production

To be able to use deliciously responsive images like this (again, about how
they're laid out, not this particular pillow picture), we need a bit more
metadata: the position of the focus point. It has to be included with the image,
either in the CMS we use, or as metadata in the filename or something similar.

And then you end up with some HTML like this:

```html
<div class="r-img"
     style="background-image: url(...);
            background-position: 50% 25%;">
</div>
```

It's not a cute little `<img>` anymore, exactly, but oh so delightful to be able
to use the same image in a bunch of different views, right?

## Update!

Thomas Ã˜stdahl here at the Food Safety Authority pointed out a trick to use
`<img>` after all:

```html
<img src="..." style="object-fit: cover;
                      object-position: 50% 25%;">
```

Both these rules are widely supported in all browsers according to
[caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/object-fit), so now we can create responsive
images with an even clearer conscience. Thanks, Thomas!

## A Final Thought

This technique asks you to consider the question, "What is important in this
picture?" This question is also highly relevant when you're writing a good
description of the picture to make the content accessible to screen readers.
Something to keep in mind. Mobile-friendly, desktop-friendly, and universally
designed. Then you can close your laptop at the end of the day with a clear
conscience.
