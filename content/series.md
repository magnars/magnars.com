[Datomic Tidbits] is a series of blog posts about the exciting and peculiar
database Datomic.

:series/description

Datomic is just a stunningly interesting database. It was designed from the
ground up by Rich Hickey in 2010 -- after he created a new programming language
specifically to realize his ideas. For those of us who were raised on SQL, it's
exciting to see just how differently you can approach data storage and retrieval.

I have had the pleasure of working with the database almost since its launch
in 2012. Join me and you too can get a taste of Datomic.
